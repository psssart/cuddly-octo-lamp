    <td>Albert Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879. Six weeks later the family moved to Munich,
        where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his education at Aarau,
        Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics.
        In 1901, the year he gained his diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office.
        In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.</td>

    <td>Pablo Escobar, in full Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria, (born December 1, 1949, Rionegro, Colombia—died December 2, 1993, Medellín),
        Colombian criminal who, as head of the Medellín cartel, was arguably the world’s most powerful drug trafficker in the 1980s and early ’90s.
Soon after his birth, Escobar’s family—his father was a farmer and his mother a schoolteacher—moved to Envigado, Colombia, a suburb of Medellín. While still a teenager, he began a life of crime.
        His early illegal activities included selling fake diplomas, smuggling stereo equipment, and stealing tombstones to resell. Escobar also stole cars, and it was this offense that resulted in his first arrest, in 1974.
        As the cocaine industry grew in Colombia—thanks in part to its proximity to Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, major growers of coca, from which cocaine is derived—Escobar became involved in drug smuggling. In the mid-1970s he helped found the crime organization that later became known as the Medellín cartel.
        His notable partners included the Ochoa brothers: Juan David, Jorge Luis, and Fabio. Escobar served as head of the organization, which focused largely on the production, transport, and sale of cocaine.</td>
